1. Angular Fundamentals
Topic	What You Should Know
Modules & Components	How Angular is structured
Templates & Data Binding	{{ }}, [property], (event), [(ngModel)]
Directives	*ngFor, *ngIf, custom structural/directives
Pipes	Built-in + custom pipes
Dependency Injection	Services, @Injectable(), singleton patterns

âœ… 2. Routing & Navigation
Concept	Use Case
RouterModule	Navigate between pages
Lazy Loading	Feature-based performance optimization
Route Guards	AuthGuard, AdminGuard, route protection
Child Routes & Layouts	Nested routes (e.g. admin layout, customer)
Dynamic Params	/product/:id, route-based data fetching

âœ… 3. Component Architecture
Topic	What to Build
Smart vs Dumb Components	Container components vs reusable UI parts
Component Communication	@Input(), @Output(), services
Feature Modules	AdminModule, CustomerModule, AuthModule
Standalone Components	For Angular 15+ (optional but powerful)
Component Lifecycle	ngOnInit, ngOnDestroy, etc.

âœ… 4. HTTP & Services
Area	What to Master
HttpClient	Making API calls
Interceptors	Token injection, error handling
Environment Files	Dev/Prod API switching
RxJS	Observable, map, catchError, switchMap
Services	API logic abstraction per feature

âœ… 5. State & Forms
Feature	Description
Reactive Forms	FormBuilder, FormGroup, FormControl
Validation	Sync + async, error messages
State Management (optional)	Signal Store, NgRx, or Services + Subjects
Local Storage / Session	Persist token/user data securely

âœ… 6. Real-World Architecture & Best Practices
Topic	Why It's Needed
Folder Structure	Organize features, core, shared, models
Layout Components	Admin, Customer UI shells
Reusability	Shared components, directives, pipes
Performance Optimization	Lazy load, trackBy, change detection
Testing	Unit testing (Karma), e2e (Cypress/Playwright)
Theming	SCSS, Tailwind, Angular Material (optional)
Logging	LoggerService, error interceptor

ðŸ§  Optional But Helpful
Topic	Benefit
i18n	Multi-language support
SSR (Angular Universal)	SEO improvement for public sites
PWA	Offline support
Analytics	Track usage (e.g., Google Analytics)

âœ… Bonus: Angular CLI Usage
Task	Command
Generate component	ng g c features/customer/pages/cart --flat=false
Generate service	ng g s core/services/auth
Generate route module	ng g module features/customer --routing
Build for production	ng build --configuration=production
